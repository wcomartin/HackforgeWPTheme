          <p><strong>.NET Standard &amp; How Typos in Tables Helped Lead to Computers</strong><br />
          <em>Tuesday, May 2: 6:30 PM</em></p>
          <p>&#8220;.NET Standard&#8221; by Derek Comartin<br />
          Creating class libraries? Learn about what the .NET Standard is and how it solves the code sharing problem for .NET developers. Ability to share code across all platforms by bringing all the APIs that you expect and love across the environments that you need: desktop applications, mobile apps &amp; games, and cloud services.</p>

          In this talk we&#8217;ll put away our computers and learn about how people used to multiply large numbers together. We&#8217;ll then explore the problems with those methods and how it drove Charles Babbage, one of the fathers of modern computing, to develop his difference engine and other machines.</p>

          <p><strong>Software Guild: Zombie Encryption</strong><br />
          <em>Wednesday, May 31: 7:00 PM &#8211; 9:00 PM</em><br />
          It&#8217;s the night of the living dead encryption talks at Hackforge. This session (which was cancelled in March &#8211; sorry) is back from the dead and hungry for the brains of fellow developers who need to keep secrets. Join John Haldeman and Randy Topliffe to gain an understanding of HTTPS and get some practical advice on how to encrypt your own websites with Let&#8217;s Encrypt. Please note that these talks have nothing to do with Zombies but we hope the clever marketing ploy works.<br />
